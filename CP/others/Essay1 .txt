I have always been fascinated with the digital things I can access. However, my interest in computer programming was increased When I got into high school with a scholarship provided by Kotebe Educational University. The school's learning environment and IT labs were perfect and helped me to develop myself in the digital world. For the past four years, I have taught myself the fundamentals of programming languages like HTML, JS, and Python. In the learning journey, I have experienced that learning through writing the actual codes and learning from professionals and peers are effective ways of learning programming and essential to pursuing my career as a professional developer. That's why I'm applying to the coding boot camp.

I believe that this boot camp will assist me in consolidating my knowledge of computer programming and the entire digital world, as well as develop my problem-solving, self-learning, and cooperation abilities, as I am expected to do on many projects that require my effort andÂ collaboration with others. It also helps me network with other developers, employers, and industry experts. Furthermore, this boot camp will prepare me for the professional environment and culture of the tech sector and equip me with the skills and strategies to succeed in the job market.
